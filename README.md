# Grounded 

A blog documenting my exploration into computation from first principles as inspired by [geohot](https://github.com/geohot) and his theoretical course [From the Transistor](https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor)

###  Introduction

 Short background before getting started and inspiration: I'm a software engineer who's been coding for about 7 years. I started doing sys admin/data center work in college, and got switched to an engineering team right as I graduated, which was both a blessing and a true challenge. I have a passable very high level understanding of most concepts outlined in this course, but so much is abstracted from me and I created this to truly understand computing from first principles. 

### Section 1: Intro: Cheating our way past the transistor

 "So about those transistors -- Course overview. Describe how FPGAs are buildable using transistors, and that ICs are just collections of transistors in a nice reliable package. Understand the LUTs and stuff. Talk briefly about the theory of transistors, but all projects must build on each other so we canâ€™t build one.
 Emulation -- Building on real hardware limits the reach of this course. Using something like Verilator will allow anyone with a computer to play."

Field Programmable Gate Arrays are wild. They essentially do nothing on their own but are completely customizable in respect to the digital circut design you want it to function as. The configuration is RAM based so it can be reconfigured ad nauseum. Before we move on to some of the details, the above article suggests I explore some even more fundamental topics such as voltage and current, which I've probably forgot about since high school science.
